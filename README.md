#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering tools, principles and methods to the maintenance of high quality software. The process involved on the creation, adjustment and upgrading of software to meet users needs is software engineering. 

The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is undisputable, it has effectively led to a digital transformation, data collection, ease, economic development while upholding security of the user.Software engineering has fostered effectiveness, communication and speed in technology.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming language like Fortran.
the establishment of Software engineering as a course of study in the 1960's.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements: gathering information of the needs for the software
design: shaping the software needs into the desired user interface
implementation: coding and other tools to formulate the software
testing: verifying to know the effectiveness of the software and adjusting errors
deployment: releasing software for users
maintenance: keeping the software up to date and problem free thought updates and other methods.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: software engineering following distinct methods, in accordance. Flows straight like a waterfall.
it would be appropriate for design implementation 

Agile: this method is more flexible as it combines different phases at a time, Aids compatibility.
approximate for software testing


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer:duties are writing code and implementing solutions.
Quality assurance manager: Verifies software quality by testing and fixing problems 
A software manager: is responsible for planning, executing and delivering software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated development Environments: Are softwares that peovide tools responsible for writing, debugging, and testing code 
Examples: Visual Studio Code,Eclipse.

Version Control Systems: Are software tools responsible for tracking changes to source code and coordinating teamwork
Examples:Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technical debt
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines

strategies to overcome include: communication, adoption of agile methods, regular reassessment of project goal, time management.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is testing individual componets of a software
intergration testing is testing between components of a software.
system testing is testing the entire software as a whole
acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements and making sure user needs are inputed.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI

It is important because it helps AI detect how best to answer a question and how to suit user needs.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.


"Explain what a computer is" - Vague
"Explain the functions, parts and uses of a windows laptop to a 10 year old"
